# leetcode-for-my-brain

This repo is my personal notebook for LeetCode problems.  
Instead of just storing solutions, I will try to break down each question in my own words and explain:

- how the solution actually works  
- what idea or pattern the problem teaches  
- where the problem is useful in real work  
- and where it’s unrealistic or “too exam-like”

I’m not naturally good at speed-solving or memorizing over hundreds of patterns, so this project helps me slow down and understand things properly.

This repo is not a solution bank — it’s a learning journal.

More folders will be added over time as I work through more problems.

## Why I’m Doing This

- I forget solutions after a few months, so I want a clean reference.
- Writing explanations helps me understand algorithms better.
- I want to stay honest about what LeetCode is good for — and what it isn’t.
- Reviewing each question critically trains deeper understanding than grinding.

## Disclaimer

These notes reflect my personal understanding.  
They are not guaranteed to be the fastest or most optimal solutions — just the clearest to me.

## Work in Progress

I will keep adding problems as I study them.  
If any notes help you, feel free to use them or fork the repo.
